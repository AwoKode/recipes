# Sour-dough bread RECIPE

## Ingredients

## Tools

## Steps
### A. Starting point - levain (4 hours)

Activating your starter:

1. 35 g bread flour
2. 35 g whole wheat flour
3. 35 g mature starter
4. 70 g filtered water

Combine and let it sit for ~5h

### B. Preparing base flour (1 hour)

1. 540 g bread flour

It depends what bread you want. I am using 450-480.

2. 60 g whole wheat flour

Also can be rye

3. 380 ml filtered water room temp

So in total we have 600g flour. Combine and mix on lowest setting. Rest for ~1 hour to let flour soak the water evenly.

### C. Adding the levain

After base is rested (feels soft) it is ready to add the levain (step A) and sprinke some water on top. Mix on lowest setting until combined. Let it rest for 30 min.

In separate cup mix 13g of salt with 50ml of water and add it to the dough. Mix on lowest setting until combined. If the dough looks stiff add little bit more water or flour if it is not combining well.

### D. Slap and fold method (2-4 minutes)

Take combined dough out and slap and fold it little bit until it catches some air, looks more flexible and forms better.

Put it back and let it rest for 15 min

### E. Stretch and fold (3 hours)

We will perform it 6 times:

1. 3 times every 15 minutes
2. 3 times every 30 minutes

Every time it should be flexible and more airy. Let it rest for 1 hour.

### F. Forming and proofing

Bench knife will be handy. (tool)

Take it out and preshape it into a ball but not touching the surface just circle motion on the base of the dough.

Sprinkle some flour on the sides and put the flour in fast moves of bench knife then flip it over and form a bun:

1. Catch back of the dough, stretch it and fold to front.
2. Catch left, stretch and fold to the right.
3. Catch right, stretch and fold to the left
4. Catch top and fold over to the bottom so it rolls back.

Cover the dough in flour and flip it back again and put to the proofing tray. Close the created line from folding with the fingers. Cover with plastic wrap and put to refrigerator for at least 24-48 hours


### G. Baking

Preheat with dutch oven inside - my max temp is 230 and it works.

Put the dough into the dutch oven and cut it throuh 3 cm deep all the way.

1. Bake closed for 25 minutes
2. Take off the cover and bake for another 20 min

### H. Final

Let it rest for 1 hour before cutting.
